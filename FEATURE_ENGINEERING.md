# Feature Engineering Documentation

This document details the features created and stored in the `youtube_comments_featured` MongoDB collection. These features are engineered to provide deeper analytical insights into the raw data.

### ## 1. Sentiment Score

- **Field Name:** `sentiment`
- **Description:** A categorical label indicating the emotional tone of the comment text. Values can be `Positive`, `Negative`, or `Neutral`.
- **Method:** Calculated using the VADER sentiment model from the NLTK library. This analysis is **only applied to comments detected as English ('en')**. For all other languages, the value is `N/A (Non-English)`.
- **Use Case:** Quickly gauging audience reaction and public opinion on a given topic or video.

### ## 2. Engagement Ratio

- **Field Name:** `engagement_ratio`
- **Description:** A normalized metric representing the number of likes per 100 views. This helps compare user engagement across videos with different viewership numbers.
- **Formula:** `(like_count / view_count) * 100`
- **Use Case:** Identifying videos that are particularly effective at generating audience interaction, independent of their overall popularity.

### ## 3. Topic Modeling Features

Topic modeling is performed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on the corpus of all English-language comments to discover latent topics.

#### a. Topic Distribution
- **Field Name:** `topic_distribution`
- **Description:** An array of probabilities indicating how much each of the discovered topics is represented in a given comment. For example, `[0.1, 0.7, 0.05, 0.1, 0.05]` for 5 topics.
- **Method:** Generated by `scikit-learn`'s `LatentDirichletAllocation.transform()` method.
- **Use Case:** For nuanced analysis of comments that discuss multiple themes.

#### b. Dominant Topic
- **Field Name:** `dominant_topic`
- **Description:** An integer (e.g., 0, 1, 2) representing the single most prominent topic in a comment.
- **Method:** The index of the highest probability in the `topic_distribution` array.
- **Use Case:** For simple filtering and aggregation to answer questions like "Which topic is most discussed by Channel X?".

### ## 4. Database Optimization: Indexing

To ensure fast query performance on the feature-rich dataset, the following fields in the `youtube_comments_featured` collection have been indexed:

- **`keyword`**: To quickly filter data from a specific data collection run.
- **`channel_title`**: To accelerate queries related to specific creators.
- **`dominant_topic`**: To speed up analysis of conversation themes.
